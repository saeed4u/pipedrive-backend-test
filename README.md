# pipedrive-backend-test
Pipedrive Fullstack role test
I intentionally pushed the .env file to make testing easy.

## How to run
Please run `docker-compose up` to start all containers. The `app` container when started, will start the node application.

To run tests, please run `docker-compose run app npm run test`
